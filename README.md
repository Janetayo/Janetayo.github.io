The purpose of creating the "ItravelAfrica" website is to practice and showcase my recent technological knowledge in HTML and CSS. As someone who has always been fascinated by
the diverse cultures present in today's world, particularly in the continent of Africa, I saw this as an opportunity to explore and learn about the open and hidden beauty of 
the continent. Through this project, I aim to continue expanding and enhancing the website by incorporating additional technological features such as JavaScript, React, and 
more. These additions will not only make the site more visually appealing but also provide a richer user experience. I am excited to embark on this journey of further 
developing "ItravelAfrica" and sharing my passion for Africa's remarkable cultural heritage. Stay tuned for future updates and improvements to make your exploration of
Africa even more enjoyable.
